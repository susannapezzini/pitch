# TIN-FLIX
Your Netflix date in Tinder Range!
Connect with people based on what you are watching

## PAIN 
Did you just get in town, you don't know anybody and everything got locked down?
Are you tired of apps that will connect you with people randomly?


## TARGET
<strong>Young and lone travellers</strong>
Bouncing places during a pandemic, experiencing different lockdowns
Who don't have the chance to meet anybody :(


## SOLUTION

Share your comments, get to know each other and face marathons together!
An when the lockdown is over and you are still human, MEET THEM
